# 📄 Lauguages

- Skript (5 ⭐) - My language of choice is normally SkriptLang. I've been working with Skript for over 3 years creating fun projects on Minecraft. I've been doing commissions for over 2 years with Skript.
- Python (4 ⭐) - I've used Python for small scripts and projects. While I don't use Python often, I feel relatively confident with it.
- Svelte (4 ⭐) - I haven't been using it for long, but I love it.
- JavaScript (3 ⭐) - I'm pretty new to JavaScript, but I've experimented with building APIs and Discord bots.
- Java (1 ⭐) - I do not like Java. I will use Java if I *have* to.
